# Using Greedy and Brute force algorithms to optimize a problem solution
## Introduction
Implementation for both Greedy algorithms and Brute force algorithm to find the an optimized solution given a restriction.
File "ps1_cow_data" shows how the code works.
The file contains animals with different weights that we would like to find an optimized way to transport them given that our transport vessel has a wieight limit.

## Requirements:
python 3.x
